		<h2>Who I Am</h2>
		<p>I’m a small business enthusiast with a passion for solving problems. I’ve grown up in and around small businesses and startups.  I currently work for an independently owned pharmacy called Conney’s, while helping keep my family’s restaurant, Shahi, stay current via web and social media and simultaneously learning how to build a brand through a hopeful startup called Splashes.</p><br>
		<h2>What I Hope To Do</h2>
		<p>My definition of a startup has always been:  a new business, not just technology-based companies, but anything.  A new shoe sstore, a new pharmacy, a new restaurant, etc., are all examples of a startup to me.  If it didn’t exist yesterday and you open for business tomorrow, you have a startup.  A startup would then develop into a small business and grow from there.   Becoming exposed to this new world of technology startups has made me realize that its not about how the term “startup” is defined or how it evolves, but the idea it represents.  Innovation.  These new age of startups are focused on standing out.  I feel that over time, small businesses lose sight of this concept.  My hope is to help small businesses stand out in their field by thinking like a startup.</p><br>
